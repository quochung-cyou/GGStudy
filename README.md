## 1. Introduction

In today’s fast-paced world, learning new skills and staying updated is more challenging than ever. Traditional methods
like reading books are time-consuming and often inefficient. What if there was a faster, more effective way to learn?

Our AI-powered application creates interactive slides with voiceovers that teach you just like in the real world. With
personalized courses, agent chatbots, and highlighted key points, you’ll grasp concepts faster without wading through
dense textbooks

GGStudy is a smart learning platform that uses artificial intelligence (AI), specifically Gemini, to create customized
learning slides, facilitating efficient and accessible learning through a structured roadmap and continuous interaction.
